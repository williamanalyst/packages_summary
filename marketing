# iOS 14 update will require apps to ask users for permission to collect and share data (privacy and data sharing policies):
    # e.g. Safari now block Google Analytics on site.
    # e.g. Facebook can track user activity on the other websites and in other apps.
        # Facebook pixels: which are pieces of code installed on a website or app. When a user visits your side and takes an action 
            # (add to cart, purchase, landing page, etc.), the pixel notifies Facebook where that information is stored as data for your campaign.
        # Note: with the iOS 14 update, you are only allowed to place eight pixel objectives on a single domain, 
            # which will significantly reduce the amount of data you can collect, report on and leverage.
        # Note: users who opt out of the data sharing permission won't be tracked by pixels.
