# Git is a Version control system: 
# which is a tool that manages changes made to the files and directories in a project.
# With Git, you can see the history of your files and recover an old version if needed.
    # Centralized Version Control:
        # Storage 
        # Tracking
    # Distributed Version Control: 
        # Cloning
        # Working Copy
        # Push/ Pull 
# Branch
# A branch is a copy of your source code where you can work without changing the original file.

# Merge
# 

# Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so users can always go back to see which results were generated
# Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work
# Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines, so it scales as your team does
# Version control isn't just for software: books, papers, parameter sets, 
# and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared should be stored and shared using something like Git.
#
# Repository: Each of your Git projects has 2 parts (files + directories) that you create and edit directly,
# and the extra information that Git records about the project's history. The combination of these 2 things is called a repository.
# Git stores all of its extra information in a directory called .git located in the root directory of the repository.
# Git expects this information to be laid out in a very precise way, so you never edit or delete anything in .git.
