# HTTP: HyperText Tranfer Protocol (designed to enable communications between clients and servers)
    # HTTP works as a request-response protocal between a client and server
        # for example, when a user is browsing a webpage, he is actually sending an HTTP request to the server, then the server returns a response to the client
            # The response contains status information about the request and may also contains the requested contant.
    # HTTP methods include GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS
