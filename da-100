# Core Component of Data Analytics:
##############################################################################################
# 1. Descriptive Analytics:
    # Descriptive analytics help answer questions about what happened based on historical data, summarize large datasets to describe outcomes to stakeholders.
        # By developing KPIs, the metrics help track the success or failure of key objectives.
            # e.g. generating reports to provide an overview of an organization's sales or financial data.
# 2. Diagnostic Analytics:
    # Step 1: Identify anomalies in the data, e.g. unexpected changes in a metric or particular market segment
    # Step 2: Collect data that is relevant to these anomalies
    # Step 3: Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain the anomalies.
    #
    # Diagnostic analytics help answer questions about why events happened.
    # Diagnostic analytics techniques suppliment basic descriptive analytics, and they use the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of the events.
        # Then KPIs are further investigated to discover why these events improved or become worse.
# 3. Predictive Analytics:
    # Predictive analytics help answer questions about what will happen in the future.
    # Predictive analytics techniques use historical data to identify trends and determine if they are likely to recur.
        # e.g. neural network, decision tree, regression
# 4. Prescriptive Analytics:
    # Prescriptive analytics help answer question about which actions should be taken to achieve a certain goal or target.
    # This technique allows businesses to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty.
        # Prescriptive analytics technique rely on machine learning strategies to find patterns in large datasets.
        # By analyzing past decisions and events, organizations can estimate the likelyhood of different outcomes.
# 5. Cognitive Analytics:
    # Cognitive analytics attempt to draw inferences from existing data and patterns, derive conclusions based on existing knowledge bases, and add these findings
        back to the knowledge base for future inferences, a self-learning feedback loop.
    # Cognitive analytics help you learn what might happen if circumstances change and determine how you might handle these situations.
        # Inferences are not structured queries based on a rules database, rather, 
            # they are unstructured hypotheses that are gathered from several sources and expressed with varying degrees of confidence.
        # Effective cognitive analytics depend on machine learning algorithms, and will use several natural language processing concepts to make sense of
            # previously untapped data sources, e.g. call center conversations, product review comments, etc.

    # Area 1: Prepare
    # Area 2: Model
    # Area 3: Visualize
    # Area 4: Analyze
    # Area 5: Manage
    #
    # Responsible for profiling, cleaning, and transforming data.
        # e.g. designing and building scalable and effective data models.
        # e.g. enabling and implementing the advanced analytics capabilities into reports for analysis.
        # e.g. management of Power BI assets, including reports, dashboards, workspaces and underlying datasets that are used in the reports.
        # e.g. implementing and configuring proper security procedure, in conjunction with stakeholder requirements, to ensure safekeeping of all Power BI assets and data.
        # e.g. data analysts work with data engineers to determine and locate appropriate data sources that meet stakeholder requirements.
# 3. Data Engineer: (ingesting, transforming, validating and cleaning data to meet business needs and requirements)
    # Data engineers provision and set up data platform techniques that are on-premises and in the cloud.
        # Manage and secure the flow of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources.
            # The data platform that data engineers use include relational database, non-relational database, data stream, and file stores.
            # Data engineers also ensure that the data services securely and seamlessly integrate across data services.
# 4. Data Scientist: 
    # Data scientists perform advances analytics to extract value from data.
        # e.g. descriptive analytics that evaluate data through EDA
        # e.g. predictive analytics such as machine learning models to detect anomalies or patterns.
# 5. Database Administrator: (monitors and manages the overall health of a database and the hardware that the database relies on.)
    # Database administrators implements and manages the operational aspects of cloud-native and hybrid data platform solutions that are built on 
        Microsoft Azure data service and Microsoft SQL Server.
    # A database administrator is responsible for the overall availability and consistent performance and optimization of the database solution.
        # Database administors work with stakeholders to identify and implement the policies, tools and processes for data backip and recovery plans.
        # Database administors are also responsible for managing the overall security of the data, granting and restricting user access and previleges to the data, etc.

# Power BI: (a collection of services, apps and connectors that lets you connect to your data)
##############################################################################################
# Basic Building Block 1: Visualizations
    # a visual representation of data, also called visuals
# Basic Building Block 2: Datasets
    # A dataset is a collection of data that Power BI uses to create its visualizations.
        # Datasets can also be a combination of many different sources, which you can filter and combine to provide a unique collection of dataset for Power BI usage.
        # e.g. combining 3 databases, 1 website table, 1 excel table could still be considered as 1 single dataset.
# Basic Building Block 3: Reports
    # A report is a collection of visualizations that appear together on 1 or more pages.
# Basic Building Block 4: Dashboards
    # For the sharing of either a report or a collection of visualizations. (must fit on a single page, often called a canvas)
# Basic Building Block 5: Tiles
    # A tile is a single visualization on a dashboard. 




# Segment 1: Power BI Desktop (Microsoft Windows desktop application)
# Segment 2: Power BI Servier (online SaaS service)
# Segment 3: Mobile Power BI Apps (available on any device, with native mobile BI apps for Windows, iOS, and Andriod)

# Questions:
##############################################################################################
# When you create a workspace:
    # you need to add the name of the office 365 group.
#
# Security requirements for management of reports and dashboards:
    # Create a workspace for development
    # Create a depolyment pipeline and assign the development workspace to the development stage.
    # Define data source rules, and deploy to test, and production.
#
# How to control access to data in a certain department?
    # Option 1: Publish the app from the department's workspace and add the users in the department to the app.
    # Option 2: Assign the viewer role in the department to the users in the department.
# 
# How should you provide access for board members (external users)?
    # Add the Board members as guests in Azure Active Directory B2B, create an app, and invite them as guest users.
        # Should not add user as Office 365 workspace, which also grant access in building/ modifying reports.
        # Meanwhile, workpace is not user-friendly for end-users without prior knowledge.
        # Should not share app with email address, because people with external email addresses cannot see Power BI contents unless they are Azure AD B2B guest users.
# 
# You use Common Data Service as a data source, and use Power Query to connect and get the data.
    # Why is the "View Native Query" option disables whereas you want to investigate query performance issues.
        # The Common Data Service does not support Query folding.
#
# How to distribute a report among executives without giving them direct access to the workspace?
    # Step 1: Select the department workspace
    # Step 2: Click the "Publish App" button.
    # Step 3: In the "Setup" tab, provide the app name and description.
    # Step 4: In the Permission tab, specify the users who can view the app.

# Data Classification:
    # Data classification apply to the entire organization and cannot be limited to a specific group.
        # You cannot restrict a dashboard based on membership of an Azure AD security group.
