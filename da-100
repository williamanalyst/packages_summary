# Exam Structure:
##############################################################################################
# 1. Prepare the Data:
    # Get data from different data sources:
        # Identify and connect to a data source:
            # Flat file location: Local, OneDrive for Business, OneDrive Personal, SharePoint Team Sites.
            # Data from Azure Analysis Services: 
        # Change data source settings:
        # Select a shared dataset or create a local dataset
        # select a storage model:
        # 
            # M Language: q query formula lanaguage that can be used in Power Query Editor in order to prepare the data before it can be loded in the model.
            # DAX Language (Data Analysis Expression): an analytical data calculation language which can be used for in-depth data analysis during the data view phase.

# 2. Model the Data:
    # Design a data model in Power BI:
        # e.g. Star Schema ( 1 fact table + multiple dimension tables )
            # Fact table: contains observational or event data values.
                # e.g. sales order, price, product counts, transactional dates and times, etc.
            # Dimension table: contains the detail about the data in the fact table.
    #
    # Table Properties:
        # General:
            # Field 1: Edit the name and description of the column.
            # Field 2: Add synonyms that can be used to identify the column when you are using the Q&A feature.
            # Field 3: Add a column into a folder to further organize the table structure.
            # Field 4: Hide or Show the Column.
        # FormattingL
            # Field 1: change the data type
            # Field 2: format the date
    #
    # Create a common date table:
        # Can be built in 3 ways:
            # Source Data:
                # specifically identify company holidays, separate calendat and fiscal year, identify weekends versus weekdays, etc.
            # DAX:
                # Dates = CALENDAR(DATE(2011, 5, 31), DATE(2021, 5, 31))
                # Year = YEAR(Dates[Date])
                # Month = MONTH(Dates[Date])
                # WeekNum = WEEKNUM(Dates[Date])
                # DayofWeek = FORMAT(Dates[Date].[Day], "DDDD")
            # Power Query: 
                # New Query --> Blank Query
                # = List.Dates(#date(2021, 05, 31), // start date
                    365 * 10, // mumber of periods
                    #duration(1, 0, 0, 0)) // period = 1 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds
    #
    # Mark the the official date table.
    #
    # Flatten parent-child hierarchy:
        # Path = PATH(Employee[Employee_ID]. Employee[Manager_ID]) # 
        # Level1 = PATHITEM(Employee[Path], 1)
        # Level2 = PATHITEM(Employee[Path], 2)
    #
    # Cross-filter Direction:
        # Single Cross-filter direction:
            # Only 1 table in a relationship can be used to filter the data.
                # e.g. for a one-to-many or  many-to-one relationship, the cross-filter direction will be from the "one-side", meaning that the filter will
                    # only occur in the table that has the unique values.
        # Both Cross-filter directions or bi-directional cross-filtering:
            # One table in a relationship can be used to filter the other.
                # e.g. a dimension table can be filtered through the fact table, and the fact table can be filtered through the dimension table.
            # You might have lower-performance when using bi-directionsl cross-filtering with many-to-many relationship.
                # You should not enable bi-directional cross-filtering relationships unless you fully understand the ramifications of doing so.
                    # Enabling bi-directional cross-filtering can lead to ambiguity, over-sampling, unexpected results, and potential performance degradation.
    #
    # Creating Measures using DAX:
        # Build Quick Measures:
            # 
        # Create Calculated Columns:
            # New_Columns = 'table1'[column1] * 'table1'[column2]
        # Use DAX to build measures:
        # Discover how content affects DAX measures.
        # Use the CALCULATE function to manipulate filters:
            # The CALCULATE function in DAX is one of the most important functions that a data analyst can learn.
            # The function name "CALCULATE" does not adequately describe what the function is intended to do.
                # The CALCULATE funcion is your method od creating a DAX measure that will override cerrain portions of the context that are being used to the correct result.
                    # e.g. Total_Sales_2015 = CALCULATE(SUM('Sales'[value]), YEAR('Sales'['date']) = 2015)
        # Implement time intelligence by using DAX:
            # 
    # Optimize a model for performance: 
# 3. Visualize the Data:
    # 
# 4. Analyze the Data:
    # 
# 5. Deploy and Maintain Deliverables:
    # 
#
# Power BI Workflow:
    # Get Data (M Formula) --> Add Modelling (DAX Formula) --> Visualize Data --> Share Data

# Core Component of Data Analytics:
##############################################################################################
# 1. Descriptive Analytics:
    # Descriptive analytics help answer questions about what happened based on historical data, summarize large datasets to describe outcomes to stakeholders.
        # By developing KPIs, the metrics help track the success or failure of key objectives.
            # e.g. generating reports to provide an overview of an organization's sales or financial data.
# 2. Diagnostic Analytics:
    # Step 1: Identify anomalies in the data, e.g. unexpected changes in a metric or particular market segment
    # Step 2: Collect data that is relevant to these anomalies
    # Step 3: Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain the anomalies.
    #
    # Diagnostic analytics help answer questions about why events happened.
    # Diagnostic analytics techniques suppliment basic descriptive analytics, and they use the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of the events.
        # Then KPIs are further investigated to discover why these events improved or become worse.
# 3. Predictive Analytics:
    # Predictive analytics help answer questions about what will happen in the future.
    # Predictive analytics techniques use historical data to identify trends and determine if they are likely to recur.
        # e.g. neural network, decision tree, regression
# 4. Prescriptive Analytics:
    # Prescriptive analytics help answer question about which actions should be taken to achieve a certain goal or target.
    # This technique allows businesses to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty.
        # Prescriptive analytics technique rely on machine learning strategies to find patterns in large datasets.
        # By analyzing past decisions and events, organizations can estimate the likelyhood of different outcomes.
# 5. Cognitive Analytics:
    # Cognitive analytics attempt to draw inferences from existing data and patterns, derive conclusions based on existing knowledge bases, and add these findings
        back to the knowledge base for future inferences, a self-learning feedback loop.
    # Cognitive analytics help you learn what might happen if circumstances change and determine how you might handle these situations.
        # Inferences are not structured queries based on a rules database, rather, 
            # they are unstructured hypotheses that are gathered from several sources and expressed with varying degrees of confidence.
        # Effective cognitive analytics depend on machine learning algorithms, and will use several natural language processing concepts to make sense of
            # previously untapped data sources, e.g. call center conversations, product review comments, etc.

# Questions:
##############################################################################################
# When you create a workspace:
    # you need to add the name of the office 365 group.
#
# Security requirements for management of reports and dashboards:
    # Create a workspace for development
    # Create a depolyment pipeline and assign the development workspace to the development stage.
    # Define data source rules, and deploy to test, and production.
#
# How to control access to data in a certain department?
    # Option 1: Publish the app from the department's workspace and add the users in the department to the app.
    # Option 2: Assign the viewer role in the department to the users in the department.
# 
# How should you provide access for board members (external users)?
    # Add the Board members as guests in Azure Active Directory B2B, create an app, and invite them as guest users.
        # Should not add user as Office 365 workspace, which also grant access in building/ modifying reports.
        # Meanwhile, workpace is not user-friendly for end-users without prior knowledge.
        # Should not share app with email address, because people with external email addresses cannot see Power BI contents unless they are Azure AD B2B guest users.
# 
# You use Common Data Service as a data source, and use Power Query to connect and get the data.
    # Why is the "View Native Query" option disables whereas you want to investigate query performance issues.
        # The Common Data Service does not support Query folding.
#
# How to distribute a report among executives without giving them direct access to the workspace?
    # Step 1: Select the department workspace
    # Step 2: Click the "Publish App" button.
    # Step 3: In the "Setup" tab, provide the app name and description.
    # Step 4: In the Permission tab, specify the users who can view the app.

# Data Classification:
    # Data classification apply to the entire organization and cannot be limited to a specific group.
        # You cannot restrict a dashboard based on membership of an Azure AD security group.
    # Data classification for a dashboard is only displayed when the administrator has checked the "Show Tag" option for the classification.
