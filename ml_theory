# Linear Regression 
    # SST = "Sum of Squares Total" = sum(predicted_y - actual_y_mean)^2
    # SSR = "Sum of Squares Regression" = sum(actual_y - actual_y_mean)^2
    # SSE = "Sum of Squares Error" = RSS = "Residual/Remaining/Unexplained Sum of Squares"
    # SST = SSR + SSE
    # OLS = "Ordinary Least Squares" = "Lowest error"
    # R-squared = SSR/SST = 1-SSE/SST = "Goodness of Fit"
    # 5 tests must be done before doing an OLS Estimation:
        # 1. Linearity (can check visually)
        # 2. No Multicollinearity in independent variables (need to test correlation, can use correlation-matrix)
            # Use (Pearson) Correlations Matrix, to test whether corr < 0.6 or < 0.8
                # Can also use pair plot (relationship between variables)
        # 3. Normality (of the residual/ error term)
            # Can use Q-Q plot to test whether the residuals are normally distributed
                # Normality is assumed for large sample size, based on the Central Limit Theroem
            # Can use Levine's Test
        # 4. Residuals should have Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance)
            # the 'spread' of the residual value does not increase with x (the independent variable)
        # 5. No Autocorrelation between the residuals
            # Linear regression requires that the residuals have very little or no auto-correlation in the data.
                # e.g. error(i+1) is not independent from error(i)
                # Can Use ACF Plot/ Durbin-Watson(DW) Test (Rule of Thumb:  1.5 < d < 2.5 )
        # 6. No Endogeneity(omitted variable resulting in the error term/ error is also related to independent variable)
            # x(i) is not affecting error (e)
                # Can use Hauseman Test
                    Note: Hausman Test is valid only whtn 'Homoscedasticity' criteria is met.
    #
    # Checking Linearity Assumption: DW-Test (target value = 2)

# Logistic Regression
    # Probablity(x) = e^(a0 + a1*x1 + a2*x2 + a3*x3 + ...) / (1 + e^ (a0 + a1*x1 + a2*x2 + a3*x3 + ...) )
    # or Odds =  Probablity(x)/ (1 - Probablity(x)) = e ^ (a0 + a1*x1 + a2*x2 + a3*x3 + ...)
    # or Log (Odds) = a0 + a1*x1 + a2*x2 + a3*x3 + ... (Preferred Form)
    # Assumption for Logistic Regression is very similar to Linear Regression:
        # 1. Data is free from missing values
        # 2. Target value is either binary or ordinal
        # 3. All predictors are independent from each other
        # 4. There are at least 50 observations in each category (not necessary)

# Overfitting = the model has focused too much on a particular dataset that the logic does not apply to the other scenario.
    # Increase the training set size
        # (could check with N-Fold cross-validation score)
    # Remove irrelevant variables
        # e.g. using PCA
    # Early Stopping/ Dropouts

# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    # Based on the K neighbors that are closest to the new data point, find the class that has most existing points in K, and assign new point to that class.
        # Step 1: choose the number of K of neighbors (default = 5)
            # Could use a scatterplot to estimate K
            # Could use elbow method choose K
            # Could use 
        # Step 2: take the K nearest neighbors of the new (target) data point, according to the Euclidean distance
            # Need to scale the variables (normalization)
        # Step 3: Among the K nearest neighbors, count the number of data-points in each catagory
        # Step 4: Assign the new (target) data point to the category/class that you found the most data-points

########################################################################################
# Support Vector Machine
    # SVM is a bit different from other ML algorithm: it uses the "least typical" (rather than most typical) elements in each category, and find a line between the 2
        # When determining the best hyperplane, it has to:
            # 1. Accurately distinguish the different classes
            # 2. Maximize the sum of all distances between each data point and the hyperplane
#

########################################################################################
# Clustering (unsupervised learning)
    # application of clustering: recommender system, market segmentation, social network analysis, image segmentation, anomaly detection, etc.


########################################################################################
# K-Means Clustering
# K-Means++ 
    # Assign N clusters, 
        # 1. choose the number of clusters, K
        # 2. select random K points, which are temporary centroids
        # 3. assign each data point to the nearest centroid, therefore forms K number of temporary clusters
            # Euclidean Distance: d = 
        # 4. calculate the centroid of each cluster
            # 
        # 5. re-assign the data points based on distence, and recalculate centroid, until the clusters are stable
#
########################################################################################
# Recommender System
    # 1. User-Based Collaborative (combination of behaviour) Filtering
        # Similarity in user-perference/ user behaviour in the past towards different items.
            # 1. Build a matrix of things that each user had purchases/ viewed
            # 2. Compute the similarity between the users
            # 3. Find users that are similar to you
            # 4. Recommend stuff to you that other people had bought whereas you haven't
                # e.g. people bought this also bought that
            # Problem 1: people's taste changes over time
            # Problem 2: high complexity in calculation, e.g. there are more people than movies
    # 2. Content/Item-based Collaborative Filtering
        # Based on the features of the items themselves (e.g. movie type, movie actor, movie year, etc.) amd actions from users.
            # 1. Find each pair of item that were bought/viewed by the same person
            # 2. Measure the similarity of rating/ review from that person who bought/ viewed the 2 items
            # 3. For each item with good feedback/ review, rank the other paired-items by the similarity in (good/ positive) review 
    # 3. Hybrid Filtering
        # Based on existing user preference, recommend items that are similar in features.
    # 4. Popularity Based Filtering

# Naive Bayes
    # Why "Naive"? = because it is based on the assumption that P(event|X) is independent from each other (which is often untrue)
        # Step 1: P(class-A |X) = P(X | Class-A) * P(Class-A) / P(X)
        # Step 2: P(class-B |X) = P(X | Class-B) * P(Class-B) / P(X)
        # Step 3: Compare P(class-A | X) and P(class-B | X)
    # Multi-class classification: (same logic, calculate P(class-N |X) for each class)

#
########################################################################################
# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (dimensionality reduction)
    # Find the correlation between variables (variables with high correlation could largely be represented by another variable)
    # PCA is actually tring to learn about the relationship between X and Y, and choose the most influential X variables
        # 1. Standardize the data
        # 2. Obtain the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues from the covariance matrix or correlation matrix, or perform Singular Vector Decomposition.
        # 3. Sort Eigenvalues and choose the most important variables (but still explains much of the variance, e.g. 90%)

# Decision Tree
    # 1.Find the root-node + internal-node + leaf with lowest impurity score (Gini Index)
    # 2. For numeric variables, rank them and calculate the (weighted) impurity score for each mean
    # 3. For categorical variables, calculate the impurity score for each combination and choose the node with minimum impurity
#
# Random Forest
    # 1. Base logic is same as Decision Tree, whereas when determining each node, only part of fields/columns/measurements are selected (making it random)
    # 2. Every time a new tree is generated in a Random Forest, it generates a "Complete Tree".

# Ada Boost
    # Unlike Random Forest, in Ada Boost model, trees usually contains only 1 node + 2 leaves (called as a stump)
    # Unlike Random Forest where each tree has the same weighting, the "stumps" in Ada Boost are allocated with different weights
        #
    # Unlike Radnom Forest, the order/sequence of stumps matters, as each stump is made by taking the mistake from previous stump into account
#
# Gradient Boost - Regression (simply for numeric results, different from linear regression)
    # Start with a "guess" for a leaf, normally using average of value of y_train
    # Similar to Ada Boost, Gradient boost build "fixed sized trees" based on the previous tree's errors, whereas larger than a stump.
    # Unlike Ada Boost, even though Gradient Boost also scale the trees, it scales all trees with the same %
    # The trees is added until the limit is reached or the prediction is not improving fit % anymore

# ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
    # Key benefit of Neural Network is that they could fit "non-linear, non categorical scenario", e.g. a squiggle such as f(x) = 【sin(x) + 1】/2
        # e.g. by adding parameters to a Activition Function( Sigmoid, ReLU, softplus, etc.), the Neural Network could simulate non-linear curves
    # A Neural Network consists Nodes and 

    # Step 1: Randomly assign initial weights and bias (also choose applicable activation function).
    # Step 2: Feed input data (in groups/ mini batches) into the model.
    # Step 3: Pass the result in each layer to calculate result (with initial weights, bias, activation function).
    # Step 4: Prediction (result) is compared to target value and loss is calculated.
    # Step 5: Based on the result/ loss, use backpropagation to re-calculate weights and bias.
    # Step 6: The next epoch (iteration) repeats the process to further adjust the weights and bias (repeat Step 2-5).

# Input Layer
# Hidden Layer
    # Nodes
        # Weights
        # Bias
        # Activication Function:
            # ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit: f(x) = max(0, x) )
    # 
# Output Layer

# Loss Function
# Learning Rate: the size of each adjustment in the iteration process
    # Low Learning Rate = small adjustment in each epoch = more epochs to minimize the loss
    # High Learning Rate = large adjustment in each epoch = less epochs to minimize the loss
    

# Epochs: iterations in the training process

# Back Propagation (for optimizing weights and bias)
    # Chain Rule

# Gradient Descent (applies to linear, logestic, clustering problem, etc.)
#
    #
    # 1. Gradient Descent is most useful when it is very hard/ impossible to solve for the parameters where the derivative = 0
    # 2. When you have 2 or more derivatives of the same function, they are called a Gradient.
        # And we will use this Gradient to descend to the lowest point in the Loss Function, therefore called Gradient Descent.
    # 3. 
    #
    # For Linear Model: 
    # 1. Estimate Function: y = wx + b
    # 2. Loss Function = sum( ( y - y-pred )**2 )
    # 3. Select random x0 and learning rate, then x1 = x0 - derivative_of_Loss_function * Learning_Rate
        # x2 = x1 - derivatite_of_Loss_Function * Learning Rate ... till Loss Function is close to Zero
    # 
# CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) = Feature Extraction + Class Prediction (classification)
    # Step 1: images are fed into convolutional layer, with filters.
        # Convolutional Layer: extract important features in images (by applying filters to images). 
    # Step 2: Feature map is passed to pooling layer, which reduce the size.
        # Pooling Layer: reduce the number of features while retaining the key differentiating features
            # e.g. a 2*2 pooling filter would reduce the matrix size to 25% of its original size
            # Max Pooling:
    # Step 3: A dropping layer randomly drops some features to avoid over-fitting.
    # Step 4: A flattening layer takes the remaining features and convert them into a vector.
    # Step 5: The vector elements are fed into a fully connected network, which generates predictions (classification model).

    # 

#
# Flattening Layer: flattern the feature maps into a vector of values that can be used as input to a fully connected layer.
